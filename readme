These are the microcode binaries for the Frame Manager hardware block in QorIQ
products. Specific platforms require specific binaries, and those also have to
further match specific software versions (Frame Manager Driver -- FMD).

   rev 107.4.2.candidate1

Features: The following IP Acceleration features are not 
supported in this package:
- IP fragmentation,
- IP reassembly,
- Header Manipulation,
- Frame Replication.
Please note that CC STD (statistics table descriptor) is supported.

Bug Fixes/CCB
This release is a result of integration with Linux environment and 
full power down management system
testing. The following are the work-arounds implemented:
- Set FMFP_BRKC[SLP] bit just before event of wake-up.
- Eliminate internal syncbefore transmitting AR packets.

Known Issues
The following FMD updates to the deep sleep transition steps are:
- The Auto-Response TX IM port is enabled during deep sleep and 
  its FMBM_TFDNE set to NIA 0x005000C0 (BMI Release).
- The FMFP_BRKC[SLP] is not set by the FMD instead it is set in firmware.


    rev 107.4.1:

    Deep Sleep Auto-Response: ARP, ICMP, ND and SNMP. Also provide AR Pass filter.

    change in 107.4.1 release is the fix of following 5 AR SNMP bugs:
    DSAR1:SNMP: Intermittent incorrect UDP checksum on response packet.
    DSAR2:SNMP: The beginning of the frame is corrupted for the NOSUCHNAME response
    DSAR3:SNMP: The UDP checksum of the NOSUCHNAME response is not correct if 
                response frame size exceed 256 bytes.
    DSAR4:SNMP: The Active Mode Hardware Parser NIA is not invoked for the case of 
                set-request message is received.
    DSAR5:VLAN tagged frames are not matched correctly in the IP address tables. 
                Frames with VLAN tags are considered mismatch in the IP/VLAN matching.


    rev 106.x.14:
    
    IP short frames with L2 padding should not be encrypted with the padding.
    Added in IPsec Manipulation Table Descriptor before encryption
    mechanism to remove the padding.
    
    rev 106.x.13:
    1.) FMan V2 and FMan V3:In case frame came from RMan and it is sRIO type 9 then
    the FD is of SG format and most likely it is with only one entry; in order to
    increase performance/latency (especially if frame is directed to the SEC)
    the firmware converts this one entry SG format frame into single buffer format.
    2.) FMan V2 only: In case frame came from SEC decryption on FMan V2 device
    the firmware removes the ESP trailer and updates the FD[Length] accordingly.
    In addition firmware adjusts the SEC S/G output frame to be compatible to
    FMan S/G format (valid only for FMan V2 devices after SEC decryption).
    For FMan V3 devices SEC HW supports ESP trailer removal and enabling
    storage profile also solves the FMan S/G compatible issues
    
    rev 106.x.12:
    Relevant only to FMan V2: Fixed IPR16- IPR malformed behaviour when there is
    discard on successfully reassembled frame.
