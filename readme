These are the microcode families of the Frame Manager hardware block in QorIQ
products. Specific platforms require specific binaries, and those also have to
further match specific software versions (Frame Manager Driver -- FMD).

   rev 106.x.15
Fixed Errata HM2 (FManV3):
HM on OP when input frame is SG and VSPE=1 may result with frame data corruption.

   rev 108.4.2
This package is IPACC + Next Generation CAPWAP

   rev 107.4.2

The following 4 AR SNMP bugs were fixed in this release (107.4.1 to 107.4.2):

DSAR6 SNMP: Varbind with length field span between 256 bytes blocks cause varbind
interpreted incorrectly.

DSAR7 SNMP: SNMP: If the community string is larger than the remaining byte length
next to the community string, community mismatch may occur even the string matches.

DSAR8 SNMP: Community mismatch may occur if the community string is located across
256 bytes boundary of the frame.

DSAR9 SNMP: Incorrect interpretation on length field if the length is 2-bytes
(i.e. 256~65535) and located across 256 bytes boundary of the SNMP frame.




    rev 106.x.14:
    
    IP short frames with L2 padding should not be encrypted with the padding.
    Added in IPsec Manipulation Table Descriptor before encryption
    mechanism to remove the padding.
    
    rev 106.x.13:
    1.) FMan V2 and FMan V3:In case frame came from RMan and it is sRIO type 9 then
    the FD is of SG format and most likely it is with only one entry; in order to
    increase performance/latency (especially if frame is directed to the SEC)
    the firmware converts this one entry SG format frame into single buffer format.
    2.) FMan V2 only: In case frame came from SEC decryption on FMan V2 device
    the firmware removes the ESP trailer and updates the FD[Length] accordingly.
    In addition firmware adjusts the SEC S/G output frame to be compatible to
    FMan S/G format (valid only for FMan V2 devices after SEC decryption).
    For FMan V3 devices SEC HW supports ESP trailer removal and enabling
    storage profile also solves the FMan S/G compatible issues
    
    rev 106.x.12:
    Relevant only to FMan V2: Fixed IPR16- IPR malformed behaviour when there is
    discard on successfully reassembled frame.
