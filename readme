These are the microcode binaries for the Frame Manager hardware block in QorIQ
products. Specific platforms require specific binaries, and those also have to
further match specific software versions (Frame Manager Driver -- FMD).
The mapping is given below:

P1023 rev 1.1
fsl_fman_ucode_P1023_160_13.bin  (**)	FMD15, FMD15.1, FMD16, FMD17.x

P204x
fsl_fman_ucode_P2041_106_1_4.bin (***)	FMD17.x

P304x
fsl_fman_ucode_P3041_106_1_4.bin (***)	FMD17.x

P4080
fsl_fman_ucode_P4080_106_2_4.bin (***)	FMD17.x

P5020
fsl_fman_ucode_P5020_106_1_4.bin (***)	FMD17.x

P5040
fsl_fman_ucode_P5040_106_1_4.bin (***)	FMD17.x

For specifics on how to use these binaries, please refer to the SDK user manual.

NOTES:
	(*)	Platform was not tested against newer FMDs, so both the ucode
		and the FMD versions are being kept at their previous values.

	(**)	FMD16 was never released into the SDK, therefore the FMD17 is
		the FMD version that immediately follows FMD15.1

	(***)	This newer ucode release was never tested against older FMDs.
		If using older versions of either ucode or FMD, please make sure
		to use the corresponding version of their couterpart.
