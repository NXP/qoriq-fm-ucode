These are the microcode binaries for the Frame Manager hardware block in QorIQ
products. Specific platforms require specific binaries, and those also have to
further match specific software versions (Frame Manager Driver -- FMD).
The mapping is given below:

P1023 rev 1.0
fsl_fman_ucode_SC1023_160_10.bin	FMD15, FMD15.1 (NetCommSw GA4.4)

P1023 rev 1.1
fsl_fman_ucode_P1023_160_13.bin		FMD15, FMD15.1 (NetCommSw GA4.4)

P204x
fsl_fman_ucode_P2041_101_8.bin    (*)	FMD14	(NetCommSw GA4.3)
					FMD15, FMD15.1	(NetCommSw GA4.4)

P304x
fsl_fman_ucode_P3041_106_1_0.bin (**)	FMD15, FMD15.1 (NetCommSw GA4.4)

P4080
fsl_fman_ucode_P4080_106_2_0.bin (**)	FMD15, FMD15.1 (NetCommSw GA4.4)

P5020
fsl_fman_ucode_P5020_106_1_0.bin (**)	FMD15, FMD15.1 (NetCommSw GA4.4)

P5040
fsl_fman_ucode_P5040_106_1_0.bin (**)	FMD 15.1 (platform integration
					into the SDK in progress)

For specifics on how to use these binaries, please refer to the SDK user manual.

NOTES:
*)	Please note that FMD15 (i.e. without the ".1" patch!) removes support for
	these specific ucode versions. For that to still work, one has either to
	remain at FMD14, or upgrade to FMD15.1.

**)	Starting with this specific ucode release, the ucode numbering scheme has
	changed: while the major numbers are unchanged, there are now two minor
	numbers instead of just one, and both the minors have been reset to what
	they are now.
